# Mark-7 Swedish Chef Speak

This is a translation app which converts English language to Swedish Chef's language.

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Description:

- Enter your text, click on translate button, and the output is seen.
- If you click translate button with no input message, message in red saying, "please enter message" is seen in the output.
- **(Additional feature)** If you click refresh button, the input is emptied (cleared) and the output will show the default text **"Translated text will be here..."**.
- **(Additional feature)** If you click the textarea when output for previous operation is shown then the output will set to default text, because we assume you might be changing your input message.
